# Software-Defined Radio Testing Framework

This document summarizes research on testing methodologies for Software-Defined Radio (SDR) applications, based on industry best practices from GNU Radio, MATLAB/Simulink, and other SDR development frameworks.

## Overview

Testing SDR applications presents unique challenges due to their real-time, signal processing nature. Unlike traditional software, SDR applications deal with continuous data streams, complex mathematical operations, and hardware dependencies that require specialized testing approaches.

## Testing Methodologies for SDR Applications

### 1. File-Based Testing with I/Q Recordings

**Concept**: Record real I/Q data to files for reproducible, deterministic testing.

**Benefits**:
- **Reproducibility**: Same input data every time
- **No hardware dependencies**: Tests can run without SDR hardware
- **Regression testing**: Detect changes in signal processing behavior
- **Sharing**: Test datasets can be shared across teams and tools

**Standards**:
- **SigMF (Signal Metadata Format)**: Open standard for RF signal metadata
- **IQEngine**: Web-based platform for sharing and analyzing RF I/Q recordings
- **SDRplay/SDRangel**: Provide collections of sample I/Q files

### 2. Synthetic Signal Generation

**Concept**: Generate known test signals programmatically for controlled testing.

**Applications**:
- **Tone testing**: Pure sinusoids at known frequencies
- **Noise testing**: White/pink noise for dynamic range testing
- **Modulated signals**: Generate AM/FM/PSK signals with known parameters
- **Multi-signal scenarios**: Complex RF environments with multiple signals

**GNU Radio Approach**:
- **Vector Sources**: Provide predetermined sample sequences
- **Signal Sources**: Generate tones, chirps, and modulated signals
- **Noise Sources**: Add controlled noise for robustness testing

### 3. Pipeline Isolation Testing

**Concept**: Test individual blocks and stages of the signal processing pipeline separately.

**GNU Radio Best Practice**: "Write QA code first" for every block.

**Benefits**:
- **Faster debugging**: Identify which stage has issues
- **Unit-level validation**: Each component works correctly
- **Modular development**: Blocks can be developed independently

### 4. Stimulus-Response Testing

**Concept**: Input known signals and verify expected outputs.

**Methods**:
- **Broadband noise input**: Measure frequency response
- **Swept frequency testing**: Characterize filter responses
- **Dynamic range testing**: Test with various signal levels

**Applications**:
- **Filter verification**: FreqXlatingFir bandwidth and response
- **Demodulator testing**: FM demodulation accuracy
- **AGC testing**: Automatic gain control behavior

### 5. Regression Testing with Captured Logs

**Concept**: Capture and analyze detailed logs to detect behavioral changes.

**Benefits**:
- **Behavioral tracking**: Detect subtle changes in processing
- **Performance monitoring**: Track processing times and resource usage
- **Debug information**: Detailed trace of signal processing steps

## Testing Categories for SDR Applications

### Unit Tests
- **Individual blocks**: Filters, peak detection, signal processing components
- **Mathematical operations**: Frequency calculations, offset validation
- **Data structures**: Signal metadata, configuration validation

### Integration Tests
- **Pipeline segments**: Multi-block signal processing chains
- **Multi-block interactions**: How blocks work together
- **Configuration scenarios**: Different scan modes and parameters

### System Tests
- **End-to-end scenarios**: Complete signal processing workflows
- **Hardware integration**: SDR device interaction (when available)
- **Real-world signals**: Performance with actual RF environment

### Performance Tests
- **Real-time constraints**: Can we process signals fast enough?
- **Memory usage**: Buffer sizes and memory allocation
- **CPU utilization**: DSP processing overhead

### Regression Tests
- **Behavioral consistency**: Same inputs produce same outputs
- **Performance regression**: Processing times don't degrade
- **Feature preservation**: New changes don't break existing functionality

## Industry Best Practices

### GNU Radio Testing Approach
1. **"Write QA code first"** - Test-driven development
2. **Vector sources and sinks** - Controlled input/output testing
3. **Incremental complexity** - Start simple, add complexity gradually
4. **Multiple verification methods** - Visual inspection, file dumps, automated checks

### MATLAB/Simulink SDR Testing
1. **Model-in-the-loop testing** - Simulate before hardware
2. **Hardware-in-the-loop testing** - Real SDR devices with simulated RF
3. **Comprehensive unit tests** - Every function and block tested
4. **Code coverage analysis** - Ensure all paths are tested

### SDR Testing Challenges and Solutions
